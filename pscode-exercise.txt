// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num1 ending 0,2,4,6,8 = even
num1 ending 1,3,5,7,9 = odd
print even or odd

ask for number
if number ends in 0,2,4,6,8 it is even
if number ends in 1,3,5,7,9 it is odd
print on the screen if number is odd or even 


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)user inputs num1,num2,num3,num4,num5
b)add the 5 numbers together for the sum
divide the sum by 5 for the average of the 5 numbers 
c)Consider num1 largest if num2 > num1 then num2 is largest and continue until you have num1<num2<num3<num4<num5
take the smallest and largest of the 5 numbers
d)user inputs 3,4,8,2,9 
add 3+4+8+2+9=26 
divide sum by 5  26/5=5.2 
The average=5.2
3<4 4<8 8>2 4>2 3>2 8<9 
2=smallest 9=largest 
 
Average=5.2
Smallest=2 Largest=9
